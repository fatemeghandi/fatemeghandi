I'm Fateme
A UI/UX intern designer and a bachelor design student, I have a passion for creating visually appealing and user-centered digital experiences. I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow in the field, and am excited to share my skills and knowledge with you.

My technical skills include proficiency in CSS, HTML, Figma, and Adobe XD. With these tools, I am able to create wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity mockups that not only look great, but also accurately convey the interactions and overall user experience of a product. I am very good with design principles, understanding how color, typography, spacing, and other design elements affect user engagement and how to create a pleasant user experience.

In addition to my technical skills, I also have a strong understanding of user research and design thinking methodologies. I know how to conduct user research, analyze data, and use the insights to inform my design decisions.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a designer, and I would love to collaborate with others on projects and share my knowledge and skills. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or ideas for collaboration.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!
